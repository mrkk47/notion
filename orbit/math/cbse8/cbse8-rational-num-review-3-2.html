        question="What does multiplication of any $$3$$ rational numbers to always produce the same result irrespective of the order of their grouping characterize?"
        answer="Multiplication is associative for rational numbers. Or, rational numbers are associative under multiplication."

      <orbit-prompt
        question="If multiplication is associative for rational numbers, what is always true for any $$3$$ rational numbers $$a$$, $$b$$ and $$c$$?"
        answer="$$a \times (b \times c) = (a \times b) \times c$$"

        question="Division of any $$3$$ rational numbers does not always produce the same result irrespective of their order of grouping in the expression. What does this characterize?"
        answer="Division is NOT associative for rational numbers. Or, rational numbers are NOT associative under division."

      <orbit-prompt
        question="If division is NOT associative for rational numbers, what is NOT ALWAYS TRUE for any $$3$$ rational numbers $$a$$, $$b$$ and $$c$$?"
        answer="$$a \div (b \div c) = (a \div b) \div c$$  We know that this is NOT TRUE for $$a=3/4$$, $$b=-2/4$$, $$c=1/4$$, and TRUE for $$a=1$$, $$b=1$$ and $$c=1$$."

        question="If $$a \times (b \times c) = (a \times b) \times c$$, what else is true?"
        answer="$$a \times (b \times c) = (a \times b) \times c = a \times b \times c$$"

      <orbit-prompt
        question="What is the multiplicative identity for rational numbers?"
        answer="One"

      <orbit-prompt
        question="If $$1$$ is the multiplicative identity for rational numbers, what is always true for any rational number $$a$$?"
        answer="$$a\times1=1 \times a = a$$"

      <orbit-prompt
        question="If $$c/d$$ is the multiplicative inverse or reciprocal of any rational number $$a/b$$, then what is always true?"
        answer="$$a/b \times c/d = c/d  \times  a/b = 1$$"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="What is the multiplicative inverse of any rational number $$-a/b$$?"
