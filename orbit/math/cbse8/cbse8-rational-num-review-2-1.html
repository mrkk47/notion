      <orbit-prompt
        question="If rational numbers are closed under subtraction, what is true for any two rational number $$a$$ and $$b$$?"
        answer=". $$a-b$$ is always a rational number"

        question="What does adding of two rational numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ to always produce the same result irrespective of their order in the addition operation characterize?"
        answer="Addition is commutative for rational numbers. Or, rational numbers are commutative under addition."

      <orbit-prompt
        question="Subtraction of any two rational numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ does not always produce the same result irrespective of their order in the subtraction operation. What does this characterize?"
        answer="Subtraction is NOT commutative for rational numbers. Or, rational numbers are NOT commutative under subtraction."
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="If subtraction is NOT commutative for rational numbers, what is NOT ALWAYS TRUE for any two rational numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$?"
        answer=". $$a-b = b-a$$  We know that this is NOT TRUE for $$a=3/4$$ and $$b-1/4$$, and TRUE for $$a=1$$ and $$b=1$$."
