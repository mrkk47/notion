        question="What property of integers did not work well, leading to the rational number system?"
        answer="$$a \div b \ne b \div a$$, division is not commutative"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="How was integer division a reason for the rational number system?"
        answer="Division of two integers did not always produce another integer, but always a fraction."
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="Where does the word 'rational' come from?"
        answer="From 'ratio of numbers'"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="What kind of numbers were included with integers to extend rational numbers?"
        answer="Fractions and decimals"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="What kind of decimals are part of the rational number system?"
        answer="Terminating ($$0.875$$) and repeating ($$0.3333$$... or $$0.\bar{33}$$) decimals"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="What is the symbol used for representing all rational numbers??"
        answer="$$\mathbb{Q}$$"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="What is the origin of the symbol for rational numbers?"
        answer="$$\mathbb{Q}$$ for quotient"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="What is a good tool to represent rational numbers?"
        answer="Number line"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="For integers, we moved in steps of $$1$$ on the number line. For rational numbers?"
        answer="Can move in steps less than $$1$$ as well"
      ></orbit-prompt>	  
      <orbit-prompt
        question="What can we find between two integers on the number line?"
        answer="Rational numbers - fractions and decimals"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="What can we find between two rational numbers on the number line?"
        answer="More rational numbers"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="How many rational numbers can we find between two rational numbers?"
        answer="Countless, infinite"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        cloze="A number that can be written in the form {$$p/q$$}, where $$p$$ and $$q$$ are {integers} and {$$q\ne0$$} is called a rational number."
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="How is $-2$ a rational number?"
        answer="$$-2$$ can be written in the form $$p/q$$ as $$-2/1$$"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="How is $$0$$ a rational number?"
        answer="$$0$$ can be written in the form $$p/q$$ as $$0/1$$ or $$$0/-1$$ or $$0/2$$ etc"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="When is a fraction not a rational number?"
        answer="When the denominator is $$0$$, a fraction is undefined"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="When is a rational number not a fraction?"
        answer="$$p/q$$ is a fractional number only if $$p$$ and $$q$$ are natural numbers. $$5/-7$$ is not a fraction."
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="How is $$-11/5$$ not a fraction, but a rational number?"
        answer="$$-11$$ is not a natural number, hence $$-11/5$$ is not a fraction. Satisfies requirement '$$p/q$$, where $$p$$ and $$q$$ are integers and $$q\ne0$$', hence it is a rational number."
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="How do you read the expression $$\mathbb{Q} = \left\{x \vert x=p/q, p,q \in Z, q\ne0\right\}$$"
        answer="$$\mathbb{Q}$$ is the set of elements x, such that x can be written in the form p/q where p and q are integers and q is not equal to zero."
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="How are rational numbers used in science?"
        answer="To convey temperatures below zero, size of viruses and atoms"
      ></orbit-prompt>
      <orbit-prompt
        question="How are rational numbers used in accounting?"
        answer="To convey debt or loss"
