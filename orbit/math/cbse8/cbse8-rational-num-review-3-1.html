        question="If rational numbers are closed under multiplication, what is true for any two rational number $$a$$ and $$b$$?"
        answer=". $$a \times b$$ is always a rational number"

      <orbit-prompt
        question="If rational numbers are NOT closed under division, what is NOT ALWAYS TRUE for any rational number?"
        answer=". $$a\div b$$ is NOT ALWAYS a rational number. **Division by zero** is not defined."

        question="What does multiplication of two rational numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ to always produce the same result irrespective of their order in the multiplication operation characterize?"
        answer="Multiplication is commutative for rational numbers. Or, rational numbers are commutative under multiplication."

        question="If multiplication is commutative for rational numbers, what is true for any two rational numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$?"

        question="Division of any two rational numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ does not always produce the same result irrespective of their order in the division operation. What does this characterize?"

        question="If division is NOT commutative for rational numbers, what is NOT ALWAYS TRUE for any two rational numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$?"
        answer=". $$a \div b = b \div a$$  We know that this is NOT TRUE for $$a=3/4$$ and $$b=-1/4$$, and TRUE for $$a=1$$ and $$b=1$$."
